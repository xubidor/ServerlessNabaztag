ServerlessNabaztag
==================

ServerlessNabaztag is a firmware allowing control of the Nabaztag/tag directly via web, without an external server (a web server is needed only for downloading the firmware and the mp3s).

With this firmware, you can connect at http://\<YOURNABAZTAGIP\>/ and completely control your rabbit with a very simple web interface, as show in the following screenshot:

All the commands can be called with a single HTTP requests from an external program/script, example:

    curl http://nabaztag/wakeup
    
In examples/check_mail.py, there is a script that turns on the nose when you have unread email and changes the lights color according to the weather forecast.
